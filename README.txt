WHAT IS THIS?

This is, sort of, the code for an old BeOS music app named Sequitur.  Unfortunately I didn't actually save the code for that app, so instead this snapshot is from the middle of a port to windows.  I have no clue what state that leaves it in -- there's no BeOS project, so piecing things together would be sort of a nightmare.  Sorry 'bout that.

All code here is free of any copyright, regardless of what might be written on any headers.  Note that this code is pretty awful -- I was still learning C++ through it all.  User beware.

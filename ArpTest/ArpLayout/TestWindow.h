 * LayoutWindow.h
 *
 * A complete window that provides an interface for editing
 * global color and font settings.  Just pass in the global
 * BMessage object, and BMessenger to which updates should be
 * sent, and away you go!

 *
 * Known Bugs
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * â€¢ The BColorControl seems to have problems -- when being
 *   sized by the library, it very often gets its child text
 *   entry controls screwed up.  It should also be turned into
 *   a class in ViewStubs so that the background color of the
 *   text views can be set, but I don't see what I can do to
 *   avoid the sizing problems...  [Well, I guess I could
 *   override things to never let its size be set.  How
 *   desperate.]

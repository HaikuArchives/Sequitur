<p>Sequitur 2.1.3 (Haiku version) Release Notes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Moved settings folder to ~/config/settings/Sequitur.
	<li>Changes for package mangement: also look for add-ons in non-packaged loacations.
	<li>Added vector icon.
	<li>Added vital folders/files that were missing or misnamed before: Devices,
	Documentation, Motions, MultiFilters, Skins, Tools.
	<li>Added Pete Goodeves Devices for Roland GS and Yamaha XG.
	<li>Devices, motions, filters, tools etc. have to be duplicated first to be able to
	modify them if they are installed with the package (read-only). Changed an alert
	to point that out and the UserGuide.
</ul>
<HR>
<p>Sequitur 2.1.2 (Haiku version) Release Notes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed crash on exit due to static destructor not releasing MIDI endpoints.
	<li>Fixed missing icons in Filters window, due to Haiku BBitmap::Archive(xxx, false)
not saving data.
	<li>Files are now saved with the standard MIDI Mimetype "audio/midi", rather
than the original "audio/x-midi".
	<li>FilePanels are now smarter: they only list files with a MIDI Mimetype
(one of audio/midi, audio/mid, or audio/x-midi), and remember the directory a file
was last loaded from when using "Save As" (rather than always going "back home").
	<li>Various internal restorations and rewrites were needed for Haiku, but the
resulting performance should be unchanged.
</ul>

<p>Sequitur 2.1.1f Release Notes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Feature:  The control change strip view in the track window can now signify
which controls actually have events in the tracks.  To turn this feature on,
go to song window File->Preferences, select the Views tab, expand All Views,
expand arp:Default, select Control Change, and check the Run report box.</li>
	<li>Feature: Added a new page in the Edit Device window, Filter.  This page contains a single property, the Input Filter.  You can select from any installed filters in your system.  When you do, any input device on the track will run events through this filter before anything else in the input pipeline, or recording.<br>
This feature has a very specific purpose:  If you have a single controller keyboard
that you switch between various devices, you can set up an input filter for each
device that maps the controls to those appropriate for the device.  In this way, a
single keyboard transparently controls all of your devices -- and, additionally, devices can be shared with writing partners who have different keyboards.<br><br>
To make use of this, you must do three steps:<br><br>

1.  Determine what control changes the knobs on your keyboard transmit.  The
information should be in your keyboard's manual, or you can use the Console filter.<br><br>

2.  Create a multi filter (Windows->Filters then Filter->New).  Typically, this
filter will be a single Controller Map that translates your keyboard controllers into controllers for a single device.  Create a multi filter for each device in your studio.<br><br>

3.  Open each device you created a multi filter for, and in the Filter page, assign
the multi filter as the input filter.<br><br>

Note that when you assign the multi filter, that multi filter is copied to the device for the duration of the session.  This means that changing the multi filter will not result in any changes -- you have to assign it again (or restart Sequitur).  Also, if you delete the multi filter it will disappear from the device.</li>
	<li>Feature: You can now drag and drop the song position during playback.</li>
	<li>Optimization:  The track windows were redrawing during editing and
		playback even if they were minimized.</li>
	<li>When pasting CC events into a CC view, it reassigns the control number to
		the current view.  So you can paste CCs to different views now, see.</li>
	<li>Fix:  When recording during a long song, the scrollbar in the song window's phrase view could be reset so that it became inactive.</li>
	<li>Fix: When recording, events that were piped to different tracks were still recorded in the original track.</li>
	<li>Fix: Pressing the rewind button when record was active would turn it off.</li>
	<li>Change:  Zero on the numeric key now is just a shortcut for the rewind button -- i.e. doesn't stop playback if it's going.</li>

	<li>Filter change:  Console filter can specify what information to print.</li>
	
	<li>New filter: Controller Range</li>
</ul>

<p>Sequitur 2.1 Release Notes</p>
<ul>
	<li>Important fix to file IO that prevents data corruption.</li>
	<li>Dissolve filter could cause crash when operating on notes with
		extremely short durations. (thanks to David Shipman)</li>
	<li>New tool bar ARP Curves (select Tool Bars->Show->ARP Curves in a track
		window) contains new tools for shaping events.  Each tool is documented
		in the Tool Guide, but in general they are used to shape control change,
		pitch bend, tempo and velocity events (and notes if you're feeling
		creative), and the curve can be altered by pressing the 'z' and 'x' keys.
		<p>All curve tools make use of a new tool seed for drawing bezier curves;
		see section 6.3.2. of the user's guide for an explanation of the Curve seed.
	<li>New menu items in the Song window: <b>Edit->Expand Marked Range</b> and
		<b>Edit->Contract Marked Range</b>.  These items are only active if
		the loop markers are on.  The Expand command shifts everything from
		the left marker to the end of the song over by the total loop range.
		The Contract command deletes the area within the loop markers, then
		shifts everything after the right marker left by the total loop range.
		If no tracks are selected, the entire song is shifted.  Otherwise, only
		the selected tracks are affected.</li>
	<li>System exclusive commands can now be added to devices.  There is no user
		interface for doing so, although developer tools are provided
		<A HREF = "http://www.angryredplanet.com/beos/Sequitur/Devices">here</A>.
		Currently, the E-mu Proteus 2000 and E-mu EOS devices include sysex
		commands for controlling the FX.</li>
	<li>A new page has been added to the Preferences window, Views.  This page lets you set the height for the various views in Sequitur, such as pitch bend, control change, etc.</li>
	<li>Multiple instances of the same MIDI device are given unique names.
		For example, two instances of SynC Modular will be named "SynC
		Modular 1" and "SynC Modular 2" so they can be accessed independently.
		(thanks to David Shipman)</li>
	<li>In the track window, holding down the CTRL key now accesses an alternate
		set of active tools. (Assign these tools by holding down the CTRL key and
		clicking on the desired tool)</li>
	<li>Right mouse button can now be mapped to any tool. (thanks to David Shipman)</li>
	<li>The Vaccine.P and Vaccine.V filters have been deprecated (although they are
		still available <A HREF = "http://www.angryredplanet.com/beos/Sequitur/Filters">here</A>).  They are replaced by the Vaccine filter.  In addition to
		injecting a motion into the pitch and velocity of notes, this new filter can
		inject it into control change, pitch bend, tempo change and channel
		pressure events.  The new tool Broken Down Line uses this filter.</li>
	<li><i>Note to filter developers:</i>  The filter API has changed.  You will
		need to recompile your filters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sequitur 2.0 Release Notes</p>
<p>Sequitur 2.0 includes an extensive set of new features over previous versions.  If you're familiar with past incarnations, here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tools are now completely user-modifiable and extensible, and have extensive possibilities for interacting with MIDI data.</li>
	<li>Filters can now be created by users with no C++ knowledge, via the multi filter.</li>
	<li>Device definitions can be created for any of your MIDI devices.</li>
	<li>New 'motions' concept abstracts pitch, velocity and controller information, helping to easily experiment with new dynamics and melodies.</li>
	<li>A new strip view, the Bank / Program Change, makes it easy to work with multiple banks on your synthesizer.</li>
	<li>The height of tracks in the song window can be changed, and their phrases can be labeled.</li>
	<li>Track windows can switch between different tracks, or even operate on multiple tracks simultaneously.</li>
	<li>Many new and improved filters.</li>
</ul>

<EM>Type: Through<BR>Maximum connections: 1<BR>Version: 1.1</EM><BR><P><I>This filter is now obsolete.  Use Motion Control, instead.</I></P>
	<P>I convert each note I receive into a series of control changes based on the note 
velocity -- effectively, I transform a note into a controller sweep. One such application would
be to write a single drum part, and 'carve' that part out of a long, evolving sound. Here is how
you would achieve that effect:</P>

<P>Create a song with two tracks, both of which have the same MIDI port and channel chosen as their
output filter. On the second track, select a sound that will play for any note duration (for example,
a flute would work -- a percussion sound like a snare drum would not work, because the sound stops
playing shortly after the note is triggered), then place a note down at measure two and continue it
for two measures. Keep in mind that you want this track to have a very thick sound. Since you'll be
carving pieces out of it, there shouldn't be any quiet time. Layer the voice or even start a new one
halfway through the original if necessary.</P>

<P>On the first track, place a Controller Envelope filter as the only filter in the output pipeline
(other than the output filter). Now open the first track and place several short notes (start with
16ths) during the two measures that you placed the note on track two. When you play the song, you
should only hear track two during the notes you placed in track one.</P>

<P>This filter generates control changes of your choice (the default is volume, control change 7),
starting with an initial value (by default zero), and continuing for the attack duration until the
start of the note is reached. The final control change of the attack duration will be the same value
as the note velocity -- that is, the controllers will sweep down if the initial value is higher than
the note velocity, and sweep up if the initial value is lower than the note velocity. The decay
duration sweeps the controllers back to the initial value. You can select how many controllers are
generated by setting the density value -- lower values will generate more controllers. 

<P>While this filter might not seem obvious from the description, you can spend a few moments using
it in the edit pipeline to understand how it works.</P></blockquote>

	<h4>Amount</h4>
		Amount determines the level of the controls generated.
		<UL>
			<LI><I>From velocity</I> uses each note's velocity to determine the amount.
					For example, if a note has a velocity of 64, then the final generated
					control changes will range from 0 to 64.  If a note has a velocity of
					100, then the resulting control changes will range from 0 to 100.</LI>
			<LI><I>From value</I> uses the value of the knob (immediately below the From
					value radio button) to determine the final control change values.  If
					the knob is at 100, then motion values of 100 translate to the maximum
					possible control change value - 127.  If the knob has a negative value,
					then the motion is inverted.</LI>
			<LI><I>Follow mouse</I> uses the mouse's Y position to determine the level.</LI>
		</UL>
	
	<h4>Motion</h4>
		The Motion menu button presents a list of all available motions.  Selecting one
		will copy that motion into the filter, making it the current motion.  Below this
		button is a motion editor, which operates the same as the Edit Motion window.

	<h4>Control Number</h4>
		This list box allows you to select the type of control change that will be created.</blockquote>

	<p>The intended use for this filter is to map button presses from keyboards
	to a range suitable for the destination control.  For example, if you have
	a keyboard with a button configured to send values of 0 - 127 on controller
	12, you can use a Controller Range to map those values into something useful.
	Say controller 12 controls the filter type on a synthesizer, and their are
	10 types, so the valid range is 0 - 9.  This filter will step through the range,
	always keeping the control value valid.</p></blockquote>

	<h4>Types</h4>
	<UL>
		<LI><I>Traditional</I>.  This is a standard echo, where each note is
		repeated depth number of times.
		<LI><I>Mouse distance</I>.  This works only when the filter is in a
		tool pipeline.  Notes are echoed based on the distance the mouse has
		traveled since being clicked.  For example, if a single note is selected,
		as the mouse is dragged a tail forms that stretches from that note to
		the mouse location.  If multiple notes are selected, they will all have
		tails that mimic the one attached to the note that was clicked.
		<LI><I>Mouse location</I>.  This works only when the filter is in a
		tool pipeline.  Notes are echoed toward the current mouse location.  For
		example, if three notes are selected, then tails will be drawn from those
		three notes to the current mouse location.
	</UL>
	<h4>Duration</h4>
		This is the amount of time between each echo.  If you select the "Tools
		use grid duration" option, then when the Echo filter is used in a tool
		its duration will come from the current note length of the track window
		you are working in.
	<h4>Depth</h4>
		The number of additional notes to generate <em>after</em> the first.  In
		<I>Mouse distance</I> and <I>Mouse location</I> modes, this is the maximum
		number of additional notes to generate.
	<h4>Velcocity</h4>
	<UL>
		<LI><I>Decending</I> Note velocity decreases with time.
		<LI><I>Ascending</I> Note velocity increases with time.
		<LI><I>No Change</I> Note velocity is constant over time.
	</UL>
	<h4>Start and Stop</h4>
		These are the relative locations in the echo curve, ranging from 1.0 to
		0.0, through which to spread note velocities.  For the full curve,
		start is 1.0 and stop is 0.0; for a reversed curve, start is 0.0 and
		stop is 1.0.
	<h4>Curve</h4>
	<UL>
		<LI><I>Exponential</I>. Linear curve raised to the <I>Exponent</I> power.
		<LI><I>Geometric</I>. Velocity is halved at each step.
		<LI><I>Sinusoidal</I>. Sin curve repeated <I>Period</I> times raised to the <I>Exponent</I> power.
		<LI><I>Sinusoidal Decay</I>. Sin curve repeated <I>Period</I> times
		with linear modifier, raised to the <I>Exponent</I> power.
		<LI><I>Random</I>. Random curve raised to the <I>Exponent</I> power.
		<LI><I>Random Decay</I>. Random curve with linear modifier, raised to the <I>Exponent</I> power.
	</UL>
	<h4>Exponent</h4>
		This is a modifier for all curves, raising the final value (ranging from 0.0
		to 1.0) to this exponent's power.  A value of 1.0 here is a linear curve.  A value
		greater than 1.0 creates a faster curve (it drops from 1.0 more quickly), while a
		value less than 1.0 creates a slower curve.
	<h4>Period</h4>
		For a sinusoidal curve, this is the number of iterations of the sin functions
		to include in the curve.  A value of 1.0 creates a single sin iteration, going
		from 1.0 down to 0.0 and back up to 1.0.
	<h4>Connections</h4>
		This filter can have either one or two connections.  If it has a single connection,
		then all events it receives and generates are sent out that connection.  If it has
		two connections, then all events it receives are sent out the first connection, and
		all events it generates are sent out the second.</blockquote>

<EM>Type: Through<BR>Maximum connections: 1<BR>Version: 1.0</EM><BR><p>I alter the value of various event properties based on my motion.
		For each event I receive, I check where it falls on the motion, then alter
		it accordingly.  The property that is altered depends on the event:</p>
		<ul><li><i>Control changes</i>: control value</li>
			<li><i>Pitch bends</i>: pitch value</li>
			<li><i>Tempo changes</i>: tempo value</li>
			<li><i>Channel pressure</i>: pressure value</li>

		<h4>Amount</h4>
			<p>Amount determines how much the current motion value affects the value.
			When the Amount: value is at 100%, then the final value will exactly
			match the current motion value.  For example, if a control change being processed
			occurs at a motion hit that is at 50%, then the CC's value will be increased by
			a total of 50% of the value range, which is 64.</p>
			
			<p>Tools follow Y is only meaningful when this filter is being used from
			a tool.  It causes the Amount value to be set by how far the mouse has
			traveled from the original point.  If the mouse travels below the original
			point, the motion becomes inverted.</p>
			
			<p>Tools follow X causes the Amount to taper off towards either end of

			<p>Invert X is only valid if Tools follow X is on.  It inverts the tapering

			at the bottom of the window.</p>
			
			<p>If Use motion from track is on, then my motion is ignored.  Instead,
			I use whatever the current track motion is active for each event being

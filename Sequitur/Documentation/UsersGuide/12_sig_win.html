<CENTER><i>The Set Signature window</i></CENTER></P>

<P>This window is used to set the time signature for a single measure.  It is available
from a variety of places:  Both the song and track windows provide an
<B>Edit -> Set time signature...</B> menu item.  Additionally, it can be accessed
by selecting <B>Other...</B> from the right-button popup menu in the measure control.

<P>
When invoked from the <B>Set time signature...</B> menu item, the initial measure is
always the measure at the left edge of the window.  When accessed from the
<B>Other...</B> popup menu, the initial measure is the measure underneath the mouse
when the popup menu was invoked.  In both cases, the first time signature is always
the time signature of the initial measure.  To simply set a new time signature, change
the first time signature as desired and press OK.
<P>
The Popup choices are provided as a convenience when changing time signatures by
right-clicking in the measure control:  This will open a popup menu that displays
all the current Popup choices defined in this window (in addition to the <B>Other...</B>
choice mentioned earlier).  The Popup choices area allows you to define any number of
commonly used time signatures.

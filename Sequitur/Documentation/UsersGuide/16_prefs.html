<CENTER><i>The Preferences window</i></CENTER></P>

<P>The user preferences for Sequitur are accessed by selecting <B>File->Preferences...</B>
from any song window.</P>

<P><B><font size=+2><a name="Section_16_1">16.1. File Preferences</a></font></B></P>

<P><B>16.1.1.  Remember Open Songs</B><BR>
By checking the <B>Remember open songs</B> box, when Sequitur is launched it re-opens
all the songs that were opened when it was last exited.  This preference is on by default.</P>

<P><B>16.1.2.  Choose Skin</B><BR>
The <B>Choose skin</B> preference allows you to select Sequitur's current appearance.  Skins must be placed either in the <i>Skins/</i> folder located in the same folder that contains the Sequitur application, or in the <i>home/config/settings/Sequitur/Skins/</i> folder.  You must close and restart Sequitur for a new skin to be active.</P>

<P>By default, Sequitur uses the Plate Metal skin, which contains extra background graphics.  If you prefer a cleaner look, select the Default skin.</P>

<P><B>16.1.3.  Open New Songs</B><BR>
The <B>Open new songs</B> preference controls songs that are created when you select
<B>File -> New</B> from a song window:</P>
<UL>
	<LI> Blank.  New songs will open without any tracks.
	<LI> With two channels of each device.  This is the default setting.  Two tracks
	are created for each output filter in your system.
	<LI> From file.  Whenever this item is selected, a Select File... window opens
	that allows you to choose a MIDI file.  This MIDI file will be used as the basis
	for all new songs.  This is a good option if you want Sequitur more integrated with
	your studio.  For example, you could create a MIDI file with the first eight channels
	for each output filter, and set them up with settings you commonly use, such as a
	piano on the first track, etc.
</UL>

<P><B>16.1.4.  Open From Query</B><BR>
The <B>Open from query</B> preference is a flexible utility that uses native Haiku queries or folders to extend the <B>File -> Open...</B> menu item in the song window.  For each correct Open From Query entry you create, a new Open menu item is added to the <B>File</B> menu.  When you select this new Open menu item, the results of the query (or the contents of the folder) are listed in a submenu.  If you have MIDI files that you access frequently, this preference can be very useful for saving you the extra steps of invoking and navigating through an Open
file dialog.</P>

<P>The simplest way to add a new 'Open from query' item is to find an existing folder that contains MIDI files and drop it into the 'Open from query' table.  This will construct an entry with the same name as the folder.  You can change the name by selecting the new entry and pressing the Change button.</P>

<P>You can also add an entry based on a Haiku query.  To do this, you will first need a query that returns MIDI files.  To create a new query, first select <B>Find...</B> from the Deskbar.  Instructions on using the Find... window can be found in the User's Guide of your Haiku documentation
(<A HREF = "https://www.haiku-os.org/docs/userguide/en/queries.html">here</A>
if your documentation is installed).  The goal with the query you are writing is to have
something that quickly returns the MIDI files you are interested in.  Remember to pay
attention to how fast the query runs:  This query will be performed each time you access
it from the song window.  Once you have written a query and run it to make sure
it performs quickly enough, Haiku places a new file with that query in the
<i>home/queries/</i> folder.  (To be safe, you should probably move this file to
someplace where you won't lose it.)

<P>Take the query file you've just created and drop it onto the empty Open From Query
table.  This creates a single entry where the On column is Yes, the Name columns
is the name of the query file, and the Query column is the query file you
dropped.  Double-click this entry and type in a name -- let's use "music" -- in
the Open From Query window.  This name will be used to identify this entry in the
song window's <B>File</B> menu.

<P>With your Open From Query entry set up, press OK in the Preference window and
select the <B>File</B> menu from a song window.  You should see an addition item
under <B>Open...</B> named <B>Open music</B>.  Whenever you select this item,
your query will be performed and the results will be displayed in a submenu.

<P>Why is this useful?  One way in which it can be used is to embed portions of
your file system into the <B>File</B> menu.  For example, if you have one folder
that contains all of your MIDI files -- say it's called "music", and it's the
only folder on your hard drive named "music" -- then writing a query for folders
named "music" will answer this single folder.  If you then turn this query into an
Open From Query preference, whenever you select the <B>File -> Open music</B> menu
item, your music folder and all its subfolders will be available for navigation
from within the <B>File</B> menu.  Selecting a MIDI file while navigating this
menu will open the file.  This can be very helpful if you keep switching between
a variety of songs.

<P><B><font size=+2><a name="Section_16_2">16.2. Edit Preferences</a></font></B></P>
There is a single edit preference, used to set the number of undo steps.  Setting
this value to 0 turns off undo.</P>

<P><B><font size=+2><a name="Section_16_3">16.3. Track Preferences</a></font></B></P>

<P><B>16.3.1.  Track Windows Follow Playback Position</B><BR>
When this preference is on, track windows will scroll with the current song position as the song is playing.  This preference is off by default.</P>

<P><B>16.3.2.  Track Windows Play to End of Song</B><BR>
By default, whenever a play button is pressed in the track window, playback stops at the right edge of the window.  When this preference is on, playback continues until the end of the song or the stop button is pressed.</P>

<P><B>16.3.3.  Initial Track Height</B><BR>
Controls the height of tracks in the song window, measured in pixels.</P>

<P><B>16.3.4.  Initial Label Height</B><BR>
Controls the height of phrase labels in the song window, measured in pixels.</P>

<P><B><font size=+2><a name="Section_16_4">16.4. Creating a Skin</a></font></B></P>

<P>Sequitur is designed for flexibility.  In addition to a flexible MIDI composition architecture, Sequitur's graphics and colors can be customized.  A default skin, <i>Skins/ExampleSkin</i>, is provided to use as a template.  An additional skin, <i>Skins/Plate Metal</i>, demonstrates that you only need the graphics and colours that you change in the skin; any you don't include will default to the originals.

<P>
To make a skin, follow these steps:
 <UL>
	<LI>Download and install QuickRes, the Be resource editor available through the HaikuDepot application.
	<LI>Make a copy of the <i>Skins/ExampleSkin</i> file and name it, for example <i>MySkin</i>.
	<LI>Open <i>MySkin</i> in QuickRes by right-clicking it and selecting <B>Open with -> QuickRes</B>.
	<LI>Edit away!  QuickRes is a complete resource editing utility which includes a paint program for editing bitmaps.  The skinnable colors are found at the bottom of the file.
	<LI>Once you have finished editing, select <B>File -> Save</B>, then launch Sequitur and use Preferences to select your new skin.

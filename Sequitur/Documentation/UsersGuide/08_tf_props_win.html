<CENTER><i>A tool property window</i></CENTER></P>

<P>These windows display all editable properties for all the filters contained in the pipelines of a tool or multi filter.  Tool property windows are accessed from the <B>Properties</B> menu of a tool in a tool bar.  Filter property windows are accessed from the <B>Properties</B> menu of a filter in a pipeline.</P>

<P>The left side of the window displays a tree listing all filters that have editable properties.  Any multi filters will contain child rows listing the actual filters.  Click on a page to display the filter's properties on the right side of the window.  The properties are defined by each filter; see <A HREF = "a_filters_generated.html">Appendix A.

<CENTER><i>The Phrase Properties window</i></CENTER></P>

<P>This window is used to set properties for a single phrase in the song window.  It can be accessed by right-clicking on a phrase, then selecting <B>Properties</B> from the pop-up menu.  While this window contains a time control for precisely manipulating the start time of a phrase, the other properties are all cosmetic.</P>

<P>Phrases can be supplied a name, which will appear above the phrase in the song window if the track is tall enough to accomodate it (track heights are adjusted with the <a href = "02_song_win.html#Section_5">zoom control</a> in the song window).</P>

<P>Additionally, several of the phrase colours can be changed:</P>

	<UL>
		<LI><I>Background</I>.  This property controls the background colour of the phrase (excluding the label, if any).</LI>
		<LI><I>Events</I>.  This property controls the event colour, both in the song window and in the track window.</LI>
	</UL>
Together, the background and event colours control the background colour of the phrase's label.  The label background is primarily the background colour, with some of the event colour mixed in.

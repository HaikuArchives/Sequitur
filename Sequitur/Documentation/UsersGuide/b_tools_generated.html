<B>Usage</B>
<p>Try using this to generate notes on a piano patch, with the grid set to 16th notes.  Also gives interesting results with percussive hits.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>If you are operating on notes, dragging up or down increases or decreases the velocity.  Dragging left or right decreases or increases the duration, based on the current grid value.  The change is applied to all selected notes.</li>
	<li>If you are operating on program changes, dragging left or down decreases the program change value, dragging right or up increases it.  The change is applied to all selected program changes.</li>

I work by first creating two measures of notes (note length is the current grid value), randomly assigning a velocity to each note, then running the notes through one or more velocity-sculpting filters.  Finally, if a track motion is active for either of the measures, that motion is imprinted at a 40% level on the notes in the measure.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
Click to create a new note and drag.  As you drag up or down, the range of possible pitches increases.  Dragging left or right effects some of the notes at the start of the measures.  This tool is best suited for a drum kit program.</blockquote>

<p>I am used to either create new events or move existing events.  When there is no event where the mouse is pressed, I create a new event.  What happens after I create it depends on the view in which the mouse is pressed.</p>
<UL>
	<LI>In the piano roll, hybrid, and tempo views, I will move the newly event around as the mouse drags.</LI>
	<LI>In the channel aftertouch, control change, and pitch bend views, I will continue to create new events as the mouse is dragged.</LI>
	<LI>In the program change view I will change the program value of the newly created program change as the mouse is dragged.</LI>
	<LI>In the bank / program change view I will change the bank value of the newly created bank / program change as the mouse is dragged.</LI>
</UL>

If the mouse is pressed on an existing event, then I will not create any new events, but will instead drag the current selection.  If SHIFT is held down while an event is selected, then it is added to the previous selection, and all selected events will move with the mouse.  If SHIFT is not held down, then the previous selections are cleared before selecting the event.</blockquote>

By default I use control change 7 (volume), although that can be changed in my properties.</p>

<p>The control changes created are based on my current motion in my Rubber Stamp filter and the current mouse location.  By default, the motion is a simple shape that creates a triangular, mountain-shaped series of control changes, but changing the motion can create more complex effects.</p>

<p>If more than one track is currently active, I will add control changes to the following tracks (up to four) which mimic the control changes being added to the primary track, but with one difference:  They are offset so that the series of control changes starts successively later and ends successively sooner, creating a stair effect.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Given a series of selected notes, I alter each note's velocity based on a combination of my current motion and the mouse location.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
Use the Select tool to select a series of events.  Activate this tool, then click and drag.  As you click up, the velocities of the selected notes are altered to match my motion the further up you drag.  If you drag below the click point, my motion is inverted, and the further down you drag the more the velocity is affected.  As you drag left and right, the imprint creates a triangle effect, peaking at the mouse location and tapering off to the start and end of the selected events.</p></blockquote>

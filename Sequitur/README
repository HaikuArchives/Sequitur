THANKS TO

Mike Masquith, Jamie, Kent Tessman, Gianmario Scotti, Jimmy Packes, and
everyone else who was sent in bugs, features, and encouragement.

The authors of Bars&Pipes for developing a modern, extensible, and
well thought-out sequencer over a decade ago, one that in many regards
remains unmatched even today.

Joe DeAngelis for many conversations on how a decent sequencer should
work, advice, and overall happy thoughts.

APT Grafix, for some excellent, freely available textures.

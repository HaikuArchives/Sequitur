<P>
The tempo window allows you to control the tempo at any point your song.  It can be opened by selecting <B>Windows -> Tempo</B> from the song window.  The tempo can range from a value of 1 to a value of 400.
<P>
The tempo window is a variation on the <A HREF = "04_track_win.html">track window</A>, so the controls and operation are similar, although some controls aren't applicable:  Since there are no other tracks, the saturation control will not affect anything.  Since tempo changes do not have velocity, the velocity button will not do anything.  Since a song is always required to have an initial tempo change, you can not move or erase the first tempo.  Finally, the wand tool has no effect on tempo events.

If you try to launch Sequitur and the first thing that happens is it crashes, chances are you are running BeOS Personal Edition and your soundcard is supported by the Be Operating System.  Peter Goodeve, the author of Music Weaver, tracked down this problem and has provided an easy fix for it.  From his website (http://jwgibbs.cchem.berkeley.edu/~pete/beos/MW_PE.html), he supplies these instructions:

	The trivial reason for this is that the internal synth (not
	the MusicWeaver itself) is looking for a file of instruments
	named 'big_synth.sy' in /boot/beos/etc/synth, but it doesn't
	exist -- under that name.  Be have promised a fix/patch
	for this, but in the meantime applying your own cure is easy
	-- create a link from 'big_synth.sy' to 'Patches111.hsb' in the
	above folder. Probably the simplest method is to open a
	Terminal and do:

		cd /boot/beos/etc/synth
		ln -s Patches111.hsb big_synth.sy

Thanks to Pete for finding and fixing this problem!

<p>The ArpKernel library is a miscellaneous collection of
classes that are useful in a lot of other places and/or don't
warrant a library of their own.  Not all of the classes are
described here: there are a number that are still under
development, archaic, or simply not very useful, which would
not be too worthwhile to include in any documentation
beyond their existing source code.</p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Classes</FONT></H1>

<H2>
ArpAboutView
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpAboutView.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is a subclass of BView that implements Angry Red Planet's
standard animated "about" box.  It is given the program's title,
version, and lines of text describing the application, and generates
a view with the ARP logo and description text animating around it.</p>

<H2>
ArpAboutWindow
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpAboutWindow.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>A thin subclass of BWindow that contains an ArpAboutView as its
single child.  This makes it possible to bring up a full "about" box
with a couple lines of code.</p>

<H2>
ArpAddonManager
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpAddonManager.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This class keeps track of a set of add-ons in which a program
is interested.  It is derived from ArpMultiDir, providing
all of that class's functionality of searching through
multiple directories for files.  On top of that, the
ArpAddonManager keeps track of the add-ons it finds and
provides an interface for accessing them.</p>

<p>The ultimate intention is to have this also perform a watch on
the directory to see any new additions to the available add-ons,
but that functionality is not yet implemented.</p>

<H2>
ArpColor
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpColor.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is a small wrapper around the rgb_color structure, making
it more natural to use in an OO world.</p>

<H2>
ArpConfigurableI
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpConfigurableI.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is an abstract interface for an object that can be "configured".
It defines methods for getting and setting the objects current state as
a BMessage, and a method for creating a set of BView hierarchies that can
be presented to the user for manipulating the state of the object.</p>

<H2>
ArpConfigureFile
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpConfigureFile.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>An ArpConfigureFile contains one or more ArpConfigurableI interfaces
for objects that together can be thought of as a complete "configuration set".
The class provides operations that you can do on this set of configurable
objects: extract all of their currently settings into a single BMessage,
apply a previously created settings BMessage to the objects, and read and
write these BMessage settings from and to files.  In addition, when a
settings file has been associated with the object, you can be supplied node
monitor messages when that file changes.</p>

<H2>
ArpConfigureImpl
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpConfigureImpl.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is a helper class that provides a standard implementation for
configuration views.  By using this class, all you need to do to implement
a configuration view is to create the controls in your view, and then call
the ArpConfigureImpl AttachedToWindow(), DetachedFromWindow(), and
MessageReceived() methods in the cooresponding places in your view.</p>

<p>Currently, this class only provides implementations for BCheckBox
(bool and int32 parameters) and BTextControl (string and int32 parameters)
objects.</p>

<H2>
ArpConfigurePanel
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpConfigurePanel.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>There are actually two classes in this file.  The class it is named
for, ArpConfigurePanel, is-a BTabView that automatically generates its
tabs from an ArpConfigureFile's ArpConfigurableI interfaces that are passed
to it.  The second class, ArpConfigureView, places an ArpConfigurePanel
in a larger view with tools for managing the state of the configurable
objects.  With this second class, almost all of the details of creating
"settings"-type windows is automatically done for you.</p>

<H2>
ArpConfigureWatch
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpConfigureWatch.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is a helper class for inplementing ArpConfigurableI classes that
can have configuration views changing and watching them.  Currently, this
involves managing a set of configuration views that are registered as
watching your own configurable view.  To use this class, all you need to
do is call its MessageReceived() function to handle the messages these views
will send to you.</p>

<H2>
ArpDebug
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpDebug.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>In this file are a set of macros that are used by the rest of the
ARP class libraries to produce debugging output.  The output is
iostream-based, and this file includes additional definitions for
writing some common object (such as BRect and BMessage) to an
output stream.</p>

<H2>
ArpDocumentButton
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpDocumentButton.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is a widget for a "document drag and drop" button.  The button
acts like a normal button, where presses will be set as a BMessage to the
target you select.  In addition, the class can act as an intermediate for
drag-and-drop operations, providing a drag-and-drop interface for opening
and saving documents.</p>

<H2>
ArpMessage
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpMessage.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is a small wrapper around the BMessage class.  It has two
main purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li> New methods are added for finding and adding BFont objects
and rgb_color structures.
<li> A new interface for getting and setting values in a message
is defined, which is intended to make constructing ArpLayout
hierarchies easier.  They are based on the idea of having the
"set" function return a reference to the ArpMessage it was called
on, so multiple sets can be batched up together.

<p>For example, a function that requires a single argument that is
a BMessage with some parameters could be called with:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
MyFunc(ArpMessage()
           .SetInt32("SomeParamter", 14)
           .SetString("SomeOtherParamter", "aValue")
       );
</pre></blockquote>
</ul>

<p>In addition, this class defines a new type -- <code>ARP_INDIRECT_TYPE</code>
-- that is used by the ArpLayout library to implement its "global values".
</p>

<H2>
ArpMultiDir
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpMultiDir.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is-a BDirectory that actually contains multiple directories,
usually representing a "search path".  It overrides the BDirectory
interface to make these all look like one big directory to the
rest of the world, so that they don't have to worry about which or
how many directories they are supposed to be looking through.</p>

<H2>
ArpNotificationRegistry
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpNotificationRegistry.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This class stores a list of BHandlers that have an "interest" in
some piece of data.  When the owner of this class wants to, it can
ask the ArpNotificationRegistry to report a change to all of its
interested BHandlers.</p>

<H2>
ArpRef
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpRef.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This file contains various pieces for reference counted objects.  It
contains the following classes:</p>

<dl>
<dt> ArpBaseRef
<dd> A common base class for anything that is going to hold a reference
on an object.  It is primarily useful for debugging: objects are given
this class when their reference count is changes, to they can track who
is holding them, and it contains a string identifier naming the holder.

<dt> ArpRef and ArpCRef
<dd> These are template classes that implement a "reference counting
pointer".  That is, they look and feel like a pointer to the object
they are templatized on (or a const pointer, in the case of ArpCRef),
but assigning objects to them automatically calls the AddReference()
and RemReference() as appropriate.  By using these classes, you
pretty much never need to call the reference functions directly
yourself, avoiding a lot of bugs that happen in keeping track of
reference counts.

<dt>ArpRefableI
<dd> This is an abstract interface that an object that wishes to
be reference counted (and work with the above classes) must implement.

<dt>ArpRefable
<dd> A generic implementation of the above interface.
</dl>

<H2>
ArpString
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpKernel/ArpString.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>Our own implementation of a string class.  This was written long
before BString existing, and may never have been written if there
had been a BString back then.  On the other hand, it provides a number
of features that I believe BString doesn't:</p>

<ul>
<li> You can store static literals in an ArpString, without having to copy them.
<li> Its internal string buffer implementation tries to avoid copying
     string data when assigning one ArpString to another.
<li> It fully supports strings with embedded \0 characters.
<li> A NULL string pointer is considered a valid value by ArpString,
     and can be assigned to it and retrieved again.
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are some helper classes in this file to help in
dealing with ArpString objects:</p>

<dl>
<dt> ArpStrTok
<dd> An OO implementation of strtok().  Takes advantage of the ArpString
     buffer copying feature to help in reducing the number of string
     copies while still being non-destructive of the input string.
<dt> ArpParseUrl
<dd> A simple function that extracts the various fields from some
     common URL forms.
<dt> ArpUnescapeURL
<dd> Parses URL escape sequences in a string.
</dl>

ExFiler uses its own XML DTD for input / output, called ExML.

For tags, composite attributes is typically capitalized, simple attributes are lowercase.  This equates to the C++ code:  Classes are capitalized, member variables are lowercase.

The tags are:

<DataType> - A single data type for a specific synthesizer.  It has the following tags:

<name> - The name of the data type.  There is a single name entry per data type.
<data> - The system exclusive data for a single entry of this data type.  There can be any number of data entries for each data type; data types are responsible for knowing how to parse and install each data entry.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
Anyone who develops a synth driver with a data type with a name of </DataType> will cause unreadable output to be written.


EXAMPLE
An example file looks like this:

<Instrument>
	<manu id>F00</manu id>
	<prod id>0C</prod id>
	<dev id>00</dev id> -- wait!  Studio info, right?
	<in>sonic_vibes/1</in> -- wait!  Studio info, right?
	<out>sonic_vibes/1</out> -- wait!  Studio info, right?
	<DataType>
		<name>Preset - ROM</name>
		<data>18...34</data>
	</DataType>
</Instrument>

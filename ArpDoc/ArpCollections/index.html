<p>This library contains various collection classes.  None of them
are currently used by the ArpLayout library, so for now there is
going to be very little documentation here.  In addition, there
are a few classes that are currently under development but not
yet usable -- nothing about them will be mentioned here.</p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Classes</FONT></H1>

<H2>
ArpIndexedList
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpCollections/ArpIndexedList.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This provides relatively quick access into an index in a linked
list.  The current documentation for it is as a StyledEdit file in
the ArpDoc/ArpCollection directory.</p>

<H2>
ArpIndexedNode
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpCollections/ArpIndexedNode.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is a helper class for ArpIndexedList.  Again,
the current documentation for it is as a StyledEdit file in
the ArpDoc/ArpCollection directory.</p>

<H2>
ArpVectorI
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpCollections/ArpVectorI.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>The is a template class that defines an abstract interface
into a generic "vector-like" contains.  (Which happens to look
much like the STL vector class.)  It is intended to be used in
public interfaces that need to pass arrays of objects around,
instead of using raw arrays or untyped BList objects.  In
particular, it allows a program to use an STL vector template class
to interact with the outside world: the rest of the world only
sees this as an abstract ArpVectorI interface, so there is no
problem if the underlying STL implementation changes.</p>

<H2>
ArpSTLVector
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpCollections/ArpSTLVector.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is an ArpVectorI interface that is implemented use the STL
vector class.  Because it is a full subclass of the STL vector (and
the ArpVectorI class is designed to look like an STL vector), the
interface to this class looks very much just like that STL vector...
which any STL book should describe... ;)</p>

<H2>
ArpPtrVector
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpCollections/ArpPtrVector.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is an ArpVectorI interface that is specifically implemented for
pointer-like types.  That is, it should be templatized on on types such
as <code>BView*</code>, <code>void*</code>, <code>float*</code>, etc.
Trying to templatize it on something else -- such as a full <code>BMessage</code>
-- will result in compiler errors.  The reason for having this class is that
it reduces the number of templates that are instantiated: all instantiations
of ArpPtrVector share one common instantiation of the underlying vector
implementation.</p>

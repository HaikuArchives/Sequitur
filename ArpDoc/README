CONTENTS

This directory contains various generally useful bits of code.  It
is primarily oriented toward the terminal emulation classes; however,
there are other bits and pieces that might be of general intererst.

If you haven't done so already, you should retrieve the ArpTelnet
distribution, which exists as a working example of how most of
these classes are used.  In addition, all of the documentation on the
terminal-related classes appear in that archive.

The code is grouped in four main categories:

Basic Classes

	These are very general, helpful classes that are used by
	the other more specific parts of the library.

	ArpColor is a wrapper around the BeOS rgb_color type.
	ArpDebug provides some standard debugging macros.
	ArpDrawPens is an interface for organizing sets of pen colors.
	ArpMessage is a wrapper around BMessage for easier use.
	ArpRefArray implements a reference-counted dynamic array.
	ArpString is based on Metrowerk's CString for string manipulation.

Terminal Classes

	These classes implement a terminal display with plug-in emulators.
	See the README.TXT file in the DiTerm directory for more
	information and an example application.

Network Classes

	The last few classes provide an OO interface to socket operations.

	ArpHostName identifies a remote machine.
	BTSSocket is William Adams' TCP/IP socket class, with some minor
		modifications done by myself to work with the ArpHostName
		class and be more generally useful.
	ArpTelnet implements a (semi-)working TELNET protocol client.

STATUS

NOTE: See the file "README.TXT" in the ArpTelnet distribution for
specific information on the terminal classes and demo application.

This library is, at best, a work-in-progress.  It is currently being
supplied for the terminal classes, which are snapshot here at
a reasonably sane point in development.  While some of the other
parts of the library work and may even be somewhat usable, no
attempt has been made to clean and polish them for public use.

HISTORY

August 16, 1997:

	• Added automatic scroll on data input or output to the
	  terminal.
	• Improvements to the terminal's paste verification.

July 31, 1997:

	• Small fixes to VT200 emulator and terminal.

July 26, 1997:

	• Many fixes to minor problems in the terminal, VT200, and
	  telnet classes.  This corresponds to the first release of the
	  ArpTelnet application.

July 25, 1997:

	• New: ArpEmulatorInterface, ArpMultiDir, ArpPluginManager,
	  ArpEmulatorManager, ArpEmulatorPlugin, ArpTelnet, and
	  probably a few more I don't remember...

July 7, 1997:

	• Fixed an array bounds problem in ArpRefArray, which was
	  causing ugly crashes in ArpTerminal.

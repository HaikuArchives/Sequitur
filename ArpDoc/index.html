<p>This package is a set of class libraries that we have created in the
course of developing various Angry Red Planet programs, particularily
ArpTelnet (the source for which is available in a separate distribution).</p>

<p>This code is being released open source under a slight various of
the <a href="../@License.html">Artistic License</a>.  The intention is
to make it as easy as possible for people to make use of the contained
classes, but to encourage any changes they make to them to be rolled
back into the Open Source distribution.  The license also has provisions
for renaming modified packages that are not rolled back into the main
distribution, so that we can avoid problems like conflicting shared
library names.</p>

<p>The current distribution of this code can always be found at the
<a href="http://www.angryredplanet.com/">Angry Red Planet</a> web
site,
<a href="http://www.angryredplanet.com/">http://www.angryredplanet.com/</a>.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Contents</FONT></H1>

<p>The main purpose of this current distribution is to make available
our layout class library for people to play with and comment on, and to
provide all of the libraries needed to compile the ArpTelnet application.</p>

<p>Please be aware that this is something like an 0.4 release of this code.
All of the documentation here has been fairly quickly put together -- you
will need to look through the headers and maybe sometimes (okay, probably always)
even the source
code to really use it.  We hope to get it cleaned up a bit, with a lot more
documentation, but it is going to take time.  Inspite of that, hopefully it will be
useful "as-is" to some people out there; and if you have any questions or
comments, do please contact us!</p>

<p>The following main pieces are included in this package:</p>

<H2><a href="ArpCollections/index.html">ArpCollections</a></H2>

<p>This is a small set of various collection classes we have developed.
Probably the most useful to the rest of the world are the template classes
<code>ArpVectorI</code>, <code>ArpSTLVector</code>, and <code>ArpPtrVector</code>:
these are intended to supply an "abstract vector" interface that can be
exposed in methods in public interfaces (particularily those in shared
libraries), as well as a couple common implementations of it.</p>

<H2><a href="ArpKernel/index.html">ArpKernel</a></H2>

<p>This is our "core" set of classes -- it is basically a miscellaneous grab-bag
of things that are useful in many other places.  Included here are wrappers around
messages and rgb_color structures, a class for iterating over multiple
directories, a helper for managing add-ons, a generic implemention of
"configuration panels" in an add-on, a smattering of debug macros, reference
counting, and even Our Very Own String Class.</p>

<H2><a href="FFont/index.html">FFont</a></H2>

<p>This is the FFont class I previously released, which provides a
BFlattenable method for BFont objects.</p>

<H2><a href="ArpLayout/index.html">ArpLayout</a></H2>

<p>This is one of the the main parts of the current distribution, the BView layout
classes.  These provide a common framework for creating control layouts that
are automatically font sensitive and resizeable.</p>

<H2><a href="ArpTerminal/index.html">ArpTerminal</a></H2>

<p>This library contains a complete "terminal widget" with add-on emulators
and other spiffy stuff.  The terminal can be used at varying levels -- from
a raw class with little support (ArpCoreTerminal), to a full-fledged "terminal
with add-on emulators and remote device protocol" (ArpRemoteTerminal).  The
library does not include any actual emulator implementations (see the ArpTelnet
source distribution for the VT200 emulator), nor remote devices (see the ArpNetwork
library for a TELNET device, and the ArpTelnet distribution for a "shell" device).</p>

<H2><a href="ArpNetwork/index.html">ArpNetwork</a></H2>

<p>This library mostly contains classes for working with sockets that are soon
to be obsoleted by the new Genki network classes.  It is included here because
it also contains the ArpTelnet class, a remote device for ArpCoreTerminal that
implements the TELNET protocol.</p>

<H2>Other Stuff</H2>

<p>In addition to the above class libraries, there are a couple other pieces
to help in building and managing the distribution.  The <code>makefiles</code>
directory contains some common makefile pieces that the other parts of the
package make use of to build themselves.  The <code>tools</code> directory
contains some scripts that we use internally to manage the distribution.
(Being only two people, we don't have a need yet for a full blown change
management system -- so we wrote these scripts just to help in passing
changes back and forth to each other.)</p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Building</FONT></H1>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: if you just want a quick peek at what the ArpLayout library can do,
you might to download one of the binary distributions, which includes just
a pre-compiled binary of the ArpLayout test program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The libraries are only distributed in source code form, so before using
them you will have to build them.  (To just build the ArpTelnet application,
download the ArpTelnet source distribution and follow the direction there.)
To build the ArpLayoutable library test program, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li> Open a Terminal window.
<li> Change your current directory (cd) to the ARP/ArpTest/ArpLayout directory.
<li> Enter "make release".
</ol>

<p>After much grinding, you should end up with the ArpCollections, ArpKernel,
and ArpLayout libraries in the ArpLib directory, and the ArpLayout
test program in ArpTest/ArpLayout.  Right now, there are very few test
programs or examples, so the only thing for you to immediately play with
is the ArpLayout test program.</p>

<p>To do development, you should build a version of the library with
debugging symbols.  To accomplish this, run a "make clean" and then a plain
"make" in the root ARP directory.  This will build <em>all</em> of the
libraries in the distribution, including ArpTerminal and ArpNetwork.</p>

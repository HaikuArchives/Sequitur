<p>The ArpTerminal library contains various classes for implementing a
terminal-style control with protocols for implementing add-on emulators
and devices that are attached to it.</p>

<HR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Overview</FONT></H1>

<p>Most of the ArpTelnet classes are implemented in the ArpCommon class
library.  This library contains classes for the terminal, telnet client, VT200
emulator, add-on manager, and various other useful things.  You will need
the library distribution to rebuild the telnet application from its source; it
should be available from the same place at which you got the application
distribution.</p>

<p>Briefly, the most important classes that ArpTelnet uses in the library are:</p>

<dl>
<dt> <strong>Terminal Classes</strong>
<dd>
<dl>
	<dt>ArpTerminalInterface
	<dd>An abstract interface to a terminal-like device.
	<dt>ArpCoreTerminal
	<dd>The basic terminal implementation and view.
	<dt>ArpTerminal
	<dd>Based on ArpCoreTerminal, this adds cut&paste
		and emulation support.
	<dt>ArpRemoteTerminal
	<dd>A subclass of ArpTerminal that talks with
		a remote BMessenger. The message protocol it implements
		is defined in ArpTerminalMsg.h.
</dl>

<dt> <strong>Emulation Classes</strong>
<dd>
<dl>
	<dt>ArpEmulatorInterface
	<dd>An abstract interface to the code that implements a particular emulator.
	<dt>ArpEmulator
	<dd> Auseful base class of a terminal emulator; it also
		implements a dumb emulation.
	<dt>ArpVT200
	<dd>An actual VT200/VT52/XTerm terminal emulation.  Note that this
	    class is not actually in the ArpTerminal library, but instead a part of the
	    ArpTelnet distribution.
	<dt>ArpEmulatorManager
	<dd>Based on ArpAddonManager, this keeps track of all the terminal emulations
		that are available, both as add-ons and those that are
		statically linked to the application.
</dl>

<dt> <strong>Telnet Classes</strong>
<dd>
<dl>
	<dt>ArpTelnet
	<dd>Implements the TELNET client protocol.  The class
		understands the ArpTerminalMsg protocol, and can be
		attached to a ArpRemoteTerminal object to create a
		complete telnet client.  Note that this class is actually
		implemented in the ArpNetwork library.
</dl>

</dl>

<h2 align=center>Architecture</h2>

<p>There are two major pieces to the terminal architecture: the
<em>terminal classes</em> implement the actual rendering and user interaction
code of the terminal, while the <em>emulator classes</em> implement specific
terminal emulations.  Both of these class hierarchies are rooted with an
abstract class, ArpTerminalInterface and ArpEmulatorInterface, respectively;
the communication between the two sides of the terminal occurs <em>only</em>
through these two interfaces.</p>

<p>The following figure shows these two class hierarchies, and which classes
in each hierarchy work with the other.  The hierarchies go from most
basic (at the top) to the more fleshed out classes (at the bottom).  Abstract
interface classes are  in *<font color=red>red</font>*.</p>

<p>At the left are the terminal classes,
and to the right are the emulator classes, located at the same level as the
terminal class that "knows" about it.  Thus ArpTerminal is the class that
actually implements communication with the ArpEmulatorInterface class,
and can be associated with an emulator to implement a complete terminal
emulation.  Similarily, ArpRemoteTerminal knows about ArpEmulatorManager,
which is an aggregation of one ore more emulator interfaces.  Thus
ArpRemoteTerminal knows about a set of emulators, and can be asked to
use a particular one of those.</p>

</pre></blockquote>

<p>Next is a diagram of the basic architecture, showing how instances of
these classes work together and interact with the outside world.  In general,
it shows that the ArpEmulatorInterface collects data -- both coming from the
user and from the remote device -- that it then transforms: input from the
user becomes a character stream the remote device can understand, and the
character stream from the remote device becomes the basic terminal
operations needed to display it.  The ArpEmulatorInterface then uses its
ArpTerminalInterface to send the character stream to the remote device or
execute the basic terminal operations, respectively.</p>

<p>(Although note that, since the ArpTerminal actually contains an ArpEmulator,
to the external user this appears much simpler.  In general, everything just
attaches to the ArpTerminal, and data is then routed with its Emulator()
through the system as shown here.)</p>

<p>The bottom part of the preceeding diagram shows how various kinds of remote
devices interface with the terminal.  You basically have two choices:</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>You can directly subclass from ArpTerminal, in which case you override
TermSendRemote() to receive user input from the terminal and call EmulateToTTY()
to send output to the terminal via its emulator.</p>
<li> <p>You can use the ArpRemoteTerminal class, which subclasses from ArpTerminal
and uses the above two functions to implement a BMessage-based protocol for
communicating with a remote device.  Your device must then run in its own BLooper,
and attach itself to the terminal.  The BMessage protocol this configuration uses
is documented in ArpTerminalMsg.h.</p>
</ul>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Classes</FONT></H1>

<H2>
ArpTerminalInterface
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpTerminal/ArpTerminalInterface.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>
Defines an abstract programmable interface to a terminal-like
device.  This is the interface that the terminal class exports
to its plug-in emulators, which they in turn use to implement
their particular emulation.  This interface is used both to write
text to the terminal display, and send data to the remote device.
</p>

<H2>
ArpCoreTerminal
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpTerminal/ArpCoreTerminal.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>
Implements the core functionality of ArpTerminalInterface, and inherits
from BView to render its screen and interact with the user.  On its
own, it is not very useful: it does not know about emulations, so all
you can do is receive raw user input as you would from any BView,
and perform raw terminal operations as defined by ArpTerminalInterface.
</p>

<H2>
ArpTerminal
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpTerminal/ArpTerminal.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>
Builds on ArpCoreTerminal to implement a complete terminal with
emulation.  You can connect this to an object that implements an
ArpEmulatorInterface, and they will work together to operate on a
character I/O stream that conforms to the selected terminal type.
In addition, the user can highlight regions of text with the mouse,
and perform standard cut&paste and drag&drop operations.  This class does not
know anything about remote devices, though, so you will need to
subclass it and override TermSendRemote() to process user input.
</p>

<H2>
ArpTerminalMsg
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpTerminal/ArpTerminalMsg.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>
This is the definition of a system to communicate between
an instance of the terminal class and some remote device, based
on BMessage objects.  The intention is to provide a character-stream-like
interface to a terminal, but with the ability to also exchange
higher-level information.  In particular, it can be used to negotiate
with the terminal about the actual terminal emulation that the remote
device would like to use and to negotiate about the terminal size.
</p>

<H2>
ArpRemoteTerminal
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpTerminal/ArpRemoteTerminal.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>
A subclass of ArpTerminal that implements the above ArpTerminalMsg
protocol.  One simply attaches a BMessenger to the class, and it
communicates with the terminal and its emulator through the BMessage
protocol.  This class can also interface with an ArpEmulatorManager to
keep track of the emulations that are currently available.
</p>

<H2>
ArpEmulatorInterface
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpTerminal/ArpEmulatorInterface.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>
Defines an abstract base class that is an interface to an add-on
emulator; particular implementations will derive from this class,
overriding its functions to implement their emulation,
</p>
  
<H2>
ArpEmulator
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpTerminal/ArpEmulator.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>
Defines the common base class upon which a particular emulation
can be built.  While not required to write an emulator, this class
takes care of a lot of the grunge work of parsing BMessages and other
house-keeping.  In addition, this base class can be used by itself as
the prototypical "dumb" terminal.
</p>
  
<H2>
ArpVT200
</H2>

<p>
A subclass of ArpEmulator that implements a fairly complete
XTerm/VT200/VT100/VT52 emulation mode.  This is not actually
in the ArpTerminal library, but a part of the ArpTelnet distribution.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>The original purpose of this code was to define a standard low-level
representation for BFont objects when they are added to BMessage
objects, which could be widely used in the Be developer community.  By
using such a common representation, applications can be sure that they
will be able to communicate with each other about font information.  This
is important for such things as dropping fonts onto another application
to control its GUI presentation, getting and setting the font used for
text in scripting, and most anywhere else that font information will be
moving between applications.</p>

<p>In the process of discussing this representation, it became apparent
that what was also needed was a simple high-level interface to use it,
both to explain its purpose and to make it easier for other developers
to incorporate it into their code.  The FFont class and its associated
definitions are the end result of this discussion.</p>

<h3>Quick Use</h3>

<p>Most of your needs for manipulating fonts in BMessage objects
can probably be handled through two simple functions.  These are modelled
after how hypothetical <tt>BMessage::FindFont()</tt> and
<tt>BMessage::FindFont()</tt> functions would presumably work, if they
were defined in BeOS.</p>

<p>Thus, adding the current BeOS plain font to a BMessage object is as
simple as:</p>

<blockquote><pre>BMessage msg;    // Target message
if( AddMessageFont(&msg, "MyFont", be_plain_font) != B_NO_ERROR ) {
    // something bad happened...
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This font may later be extracted with a similar function call:</p>

<blockquote><pre>BFont font(be_plain_font);    // Retrieved font
if( FindMessageFont(&msg, "MyFont", 0, &font) != B_NO_ERROR ) {
	// unable to retrieve font...
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>One thing you should be aware of when retrieving a font as shown
above: while not discussed here, it is possible to store partial
font representations.  Thus <tt>FindMessageFont()</tt> may only change
a few or even none of the attributes of the target font object.  You
should thus always be sure to initialize the object with values you
can live with.</p>

<p>(The example here initializes the target font with the user's plain
font; you will typically initialize it with whatever your "current" font
is.  This allows you you to receive partial fonts that, for example,
only change the size of whatever font you are currently using.)</p>

<hr>
<h3>FFont and Extensions</h3>

<p>The complete flattened font representation is defined by the FFont
class, which is a subclass of BFont.  It adds two main enhancements
to BeOS's built-in font class:</p>

<ol>
	<li> <p>The FFont class implements a BFlattenable interface, so that
		it can be placed in a BMessage or otherwise used in the same
		way as any other
		flattenable object.  The flattened representation of an FFont
		is defined so that it can be safely moved across different
		machines and platforms.  See the BFlattenable class in the
		BeBook's support kit chapter for more information on using
		this interface.</p>
		
	<li> <p>Each FFont object carries with it an additional "attribute
		mask."  This is used to indicate which of the object's
		various BFont attributes (family and style, size, rotation,
		etc.) are "important."  It is used to perform partial copies
		between font objects, and is stored in the font's flattened
		representation so that the receiver of a font can be directed
		to change only part of its current font.</p>
</ol>

<p>The FFont attribute mask is modelled after the mask used in BView's
<tt>SetFont()</tt> function; in fact, it uses the exact same bit
definitions, such as B_FONT_SIZE, B_FONT_FAMILY_AND_STYLE.  The current
mask is set and retrieved just like other font attributes, with the
new functions <tt>SetMask()</tt> and <tt>Mask()</tt>.</p>

<p>Beyond being part of a font's flattened information, the attribute mask
is used in only two places, the new FFont functions
<tt>UpdateTo()</tt> and <tt>UpdateFrom()</tt>.  These functions copy
a font's attributes to/from (respectively) another font object, but
only those attributes for which the source font's cooresponding mask
bit is <tt>true</tt>.</p>

<p>For example, the following function will copy and font family and size
name from the system plain font into an existing BFont:</p>

<blockquote><pre>void GetPlainFamilyStyle(BFont* dest)
{
    FFont pfont(be_plain_font);             // Copy the plain font
    pfont.SetMask(B_FONT_FAMILY_AND_STYLE); // Select only family & style
    pfont.UpdateTo(dest);                   // Copy into destination
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: Clearing particular bits in the attribute mask of a font
does <em>not</em> mean that their corresponding BFont values can be
set to anything.  An FFont object should always remain a valid, reasonable
BFont object, regardless of how the FFont mask is set.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Constructor and Destructor</h2>
<hr>

<h3>FFont()</h3>

<blockquote><pre>FFont();
FFont(const BFont &amp;font);
FFont(const BFont *font);

FFont(const FFont &amp;font);
FFont(const FFont *font);</pre></blockquote>

<p>Like a normal BFont, a new FFont can be initialized with either the default
values, or a pointer or reference to a BFont object from which it is to be copied.
In addition, initializing from a pointer or reference to another FFont object
will also copy the other's attribute mask.  (When not copying from
another FFont, the new object's attribute mask is initialize to
B_FONT_ALL.)</p>

<hr>
<h2>Operators</h2>
<hr>

<h3>operator=()</h3>

<blockquote><pre>FFont&amp; operator=(const BFont &amp;font); 
FFont&amp; operator=(const FFont &amp;font); 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Either BFont or FFont objects can be assigned to an existing
FFont object.  If a BFont is assigned to an FFont, the destination
object's attribute mask is reset to B_FONT_ALL; in contrast, if another
FFont is assigned to it, the original's attribute mask is copied over.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<hr>

<h3>SetMask(), Mask()</h3>

<blockquote><pre>void SetMask(uint32 mask);
uint32 Mask(void) const;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In addition to all the normal BFont attributes, and FFont also
has an "attribute mask."  This is an integer mask that indicates which
of the basic BFont attributes (family and style name, size, rotation,
encoding, etc.) are "important."  The mask takes on the same values
as BView's SetFont() function: B_FONT_FAMILY_AND_STYLE, B_FONT_SIZE,
B_FONT_ROTATION, B_FONT_ENCODING, etc., which can be logically or'ed
together to select the various attributes.  The value B_FONT_ALL stands
for all attributes, and is the default.</p>

<p>Note that clearing a certain attribute mask bit does <em>not</em>
mean that the corresponding BFont attribute can be anything.  These
bits are only a guide, and the FFont should always be valid and
reasonable even if they are ignored.</p>

<hr>
<h3>UpdateTo(), UpdateFrom()</h3>

<blockquote><pre>void UpdateTo(BFont* font, uint32 mask = B_FONT_ALL) const;
void UpdateTo(FFont* font, uint32 mask = B_FONT_ALL) const;
void UpdateFrom(const FFont* font, uint32 mask = B_FONT_ALL);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>These methods copy one FFont to or from another font object, respecting
the source font's attribute bits.  This can be thought of as similar to
BView's SetFont() method, but where the object being set is another font.
</p>

<p>The actual attributes that are copied is determined by taking the
logical and of the source font object and the <em>mask</em> parameter
that is passed in as the second argument.  Thus the default is to copy
only those attributes for which the source font's attribute mask bits
are set.</p>

<p><em>UpdateTo()</em> copies the attributes from the member's object
into another selected BFont or FFont.  If the destination is an FFont,
the attribute mask of the source is logically or'ed into the destination's
mask, indicating that all its existing values plus the newly changed
ones are "important."</p>

<p><tt>font1->UpdateTo(font2,mask)</tt> is equivalent to
<tt>font2->UpdateFrom(font1,mask)</tt> if both <tt>font1</tt> and
<tt>font2</tt> are FFont objects.</p>

<p>As an example, this code will copy the family and style of the
system plain font into in existing BFont object named <em>myFont</em>:</p>
<blockquote><pre>FFont(be_plain_font).UpdateTo(myFont,B_FONT_FAMILY_AND_STYLE);
</pre></blockquote>

<hr>
<h3>IsFixedSize(), TypeCode(), FlattenedSize(),
AllowsTypeCode(), Flatten(), Unflatten()</h3>

<blockquote><pre>virtual bool      IsFixedSize() const;
virtual	type_code TypeCode() const;
virtual	ssize_t   FlattenedSize() const;
virtual	bool      AllowsTypeCode(type_code code) const;
virtual	status_t  Flatten(void *buffer, ssize_t size) const;
virtual	status_t  Unflatten(type_code c, const void *buf, ssize_t size);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>These methods implement the complete BFlattenable interface.  See
support/BFlattenable for more information on how to use them.</p>

<p>A flattened font is stored with the type code FFont::FONT_TYPE, which
is defined as <tt>'FONt'</tt>.  The flattened representation includes all
BFont attributes (family name, style name, size, shear, rotation, spacing
encoding, face, flags), plus the FFont's attribute mask.  This last is
used so that the source of a message can indicate which of the font
attributes are important.  For example, if you are interested in only
changing the font size used by another application, you could flatten
an FFont that is set to the desired size and only has the B_FONT_SIZE
attribute bit set.</p>

<p><b>NOTE</b>: If you are sending a partially defined font as described
above, you <em>must</em> be sure to still set the other attributes to
reasonable values.  The receiver of the font is free to ignore the
attribute mask you send, and directly use the entire font description
it is given.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Test()</h3>
<blockquote><pre>static void Test(void);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This static inline function can be used to perform a brief sanity
check of the FFont implementation.  When called, it creates various
FFont objects and performs operations on them, printing the results of
these to stdout.</p>

<p>Note that this test does not pretend to be either comprehensive or
particularily understandable.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Convenience Functions</h2>

<p>These are functions that are not a formal part of the FFont class
itself, but provide a simple interface to how FFont objects are most
commonly used.</p>

<hr>
<h3>AddMessageFont()</h3>

<blockquote><pre>status_t
AddMessageFont(BMessage* msg, const char *name, const FFont *font);
status_t
AddMessageFont(BMessage* msg, const char *name, const BFont *font);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This function is the moral equivalent to having an "AddFont()" method
as part of the BMessage interface; since we don't, a global function is
provided instead.</p>

<p>Calling <b>AddMessageFont()</b> adds the given BFont or FFont object
<em>font</em>
to the BMessage object <em>msg</em>, under the name <em>name</em>.  The
BMessage method <b>AddFlat()</b> is used internally to accomplish this.</p>

<p>If <em>font</em> is an actual FFont, the given object is added to the
message exactly as is.  If <em>font</em> is instead a basic BFont, an
equivalent FFont object is added with its attribute mask set
to B_FONT_ALL.</p>

<p>Any errors encountered by this function are reported as per the
standard BMessage add methods.</p>

<hr>
<h3>FindMessageFont()</h3>

<blockquote><pre>status_t
FindMessageFont(const BMessage* msg, const char *name,
                int32 index, FFont *font);
status_t
FindMessageFont(const BMessage* msg, const char *name,
                int32 index, BFont *font);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This function is the moral equivalent to having a "FindFont()" method
as part of the BMessage interface; since we don't, a global function is
provided instead.</p>

<p>Calling <b>FindMessageFont()</b> looks for an FFont object in the
given BMessage <em>msg</em>, under the name <em>name</em> and at
index number <em>index</em>.  If one is found, it is placed in the
destination font object <em>font</em>.  The
BMessage method <b>FindFlat()</b> is used internally to accomplish this.</p>

<p>If <em>font</em> points to an actual FFont, it is filled with the
exact font information found in the message.  Otherwise, if <em>font</em>
points to a basic BFont object, the font mask attributes in the BMessage
are used to determine which of the attributes of the destination object
are changed.  This latter case is the equivalent of retrieving a
complete FFont object and using its UpdateTo() method to copy it into
the final destination BFont.</p>

<p>Any errors encountered by this function are reported as per the
standard BMessage find methods.  If an error occurs, the destination
object <em>font</em> is left unchanged.</p>

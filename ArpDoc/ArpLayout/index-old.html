<h3>Yet Another Layout Library...</h3>

<p>This layout library was started back in the days of DR8.  It didn't change
for a long time after that first prototype because, until R4, manually
resizing BViews has been too slow
to (IMHO) make a layout library based on them practical.  However,
now with the coming of R4 and its new Begin/EndViewTransaction()
mechanism -- as well as the fact that there <em>still</em> doesn't
seem to be a layout library that completely meets our needs -- I have
cleaned up the code so that it is semi-usable (at least for my needs),
and decided to release what I have as open source.</p>

<p>The main features/goals of this library are:</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Integrate well with the rest of the BeOS system.</strong>
     This means it should
     use the existing Be-supplied controls wherever appropriate, with
     as little modification to them as possible.  It also should make use of
     other existing OS services (such as the BMessage) instead of
     implementing its own.<p>

<li> <strong>Be light-weight and simple.</strong>  Related to the
     first requirement, the library should introduce as few new
     concepts as possible and require little memory and code in addition
     to the existing Be classes.<p>

<li> <strong>Distributed as Open Source.</strong>  So that someone
     using the library does not become dependent on the person who
     created the source.<p>

<li> <strong>Automatically conform to any font size(s) and automatically
     resize layout to conform to its exterior dimensions.</strong>
     Which goes without saying, I suppose.  More pointedly, I don't
     want to have to think about where controls should be placed in
     terms of pixels, "dialog units", or anything like that.  I don't
     care.  I just want to generally specify their positions relative
     to each other, and let the program take care of the pixel location
     details.<p>

<li> <strong>A flexible and well defined layout architecture.</strong>
     This means to provide the equivalent of the traditional concept of
     "layout managers."  Organize a view hierarchy as user
     interface controls that are placed inside parent containers, where
     the latter actually determine where to place the basic controls on
     the screen.  (But hopefully we can learn something from X and
     other implementations of this, and do a better job at it...)<p>

<li> <strong>Include the ability to embed a layout hierarchy in a
     larger BView hierarchy.</strong>  In other words, the layout
     library should not depend on having any control over the
     surrounding window.  You should be able to create a layout
     of controls and pass this as a root BView to
     some other containing object that knows nothing about the
     layout library being used.<p>

</ul>

<p>Be sure to look at the source code in <code>ArpTest/ArpLayout</code>
to get a feel for one (possible) way to use the library!</p>

<HR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Overview</FONT></H1>

<p>The ArpLayout library implements a traditional "layout manager / control"
GUI architecture.  That is, there are two fairly distinct types of
classes:</p>

<dl>
<dt> Controls
<dd> <p>These are the parts of the interface that the user interacts with.
     A control always a BView, because it needs to see user events such
     as the keyboard and mouse to provide something the user can
     interact with.</p>

     <p>In addition to all of the functionality of a BView, a control must
     be able to report accurate information about its dimensions based
     on its current font and other parts of the environment.  This is
     similar to the existing BView::GetPreferredSize() method, but
     includes a bit more information and <em>must</em> return a
     useful value, whatever the object's current state.</p>

     <p>(Unfortunately, the GetPreferredSize() implemented in a lot of the
     Be-supplied
     classes is either touchy about returning correct information
     or doesn't return anything useful at all.)</p>

<dt> Layout Managers
<dd> <p>These are the objects used to construct an actual
     layout hierarchy.  A layout manager contains one or more child
     objects, and implements a specific algorithm to determine where
     the children should be placed within the manager's screen space
     (i.e. its Bounds() rectangle) and how big they should be.
     Ideally, the library architecture should allow a layout manager
     class to implement any arbitrary layout algorithm it likes.</p>

     <p>The children of a layout manager may be either basic controls
     or other layout managers.  Building a tree of layout managers
     and controls defines an explicit relationship between the various
     user interface objects, so that they will automatically be
     correctly positioned based on the font(s) being used and the
     size of the containing area.</p>

     <p>A layout manager is often not associated with an actual
     BView -- it does not need to directly interact with the user,
     so there is no need to include all of that overhead.  Two
     layout managers currently come with the ArpLayout library,
     ArpRunningBar and ArpScrollArea.</p>
</dl>

<p>The core piece of the ArpLayout library is a class called
ArpLayoutable.  This is a simple base class (derived only from
BArchivable) that defines the abstract interface between parent
and child in the layout hierarchy.  Its major pieces of
functionality are:</p>

<dl>
<dt> The ability to query an object for its desired dimensions.
<dd> A layout manager uses this capability of its children to determine
     how best to place them.
<dt> Managing the position and size of an object.
<dd> A layout manager uses this capability of its children to actually
     put them where it wants them to go.
<dt> The ability to associate "constraints" with an object.
<dd> These are used as parameters to the layout manager, which
     provides additional information about how to place
     the child that they are associated with.
<dt> The association of a BView with an ArpLayoutable.
<dd> An ArpLayoutable object may not be associated with
     a BView if it doesn't need to interact with the
     user.  There are various functions to manage this situation.
</dl>

<H2>The Layout Hierarchy</H2>

<p>At the most fundamental level, ArpLayoutable provides a set of functions for
managing a hierarchy of object.  These directly match the ones found in BView:</p>

<blockquote><table>
	<tr> <td>AddLayoutChild() <td>AddChild() </tr>
	<tr> <td>RemoveLayoutChild() <td>RemoveChild() </tr>
	<tr> <td>LayoutParent() <td>Parent() </tr>
	<tr> <td>CountLayoutChildren() <td>CountChildren() </tr>
	<tr> <td>LayoutChildAt() <td>ChildAt() </tr>
	<tr> <td>NextLayoutSibling() <td>NextSibling() </tr>
	<tr> <td>PreviousLayoutSibling() <td>PreviousSibling() </tr>
	<tr> <td>LayoutRemoveSelf() <td>LayoutRemoveSelf() </tr>
	<tr> <td>FindLayoutable() <td>FindView() </tr>
</table></blockquote>

<p>This is an important point: The ArpLayoutable class defines an
<em>additional</em> hierarchy, on top of the existing BView hierarchy.
This relationship is easy to derive -- the underlying BView hierarchy
is simply the ArpLayoutable hierarchy with all of the objects that
do not have an associated BView object removed.</p>

<p>Another way to think of this is as light-weight ArpLayoutable objects
sitting "in-between" the full BViews, guiding them in the layout.
For example, consider a simple BView hierarchy such as this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
BView Root -+- BMenuBar
            +- BTextView
            +- BBox ------+- BButton
                          +- BButton
                          +- BButton
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This may be embedded within a larger ArpLayoutable hierarchy
that runs like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
View/Layout Root - VerticalGroup -+- Wrap - BMenuBar
                                  +- Wrap - BTextView
                                  +- Wrap - BBox --- HorizontalGroup -+- Wrap - BButton
                                                                      +- Wrap - BButton
                                                                      +- Wrap - BButton
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Which would probably result in a window that looks something like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
 _____________
/Layout Window\_____________________________
|                                           |
| BMenuBar                                  |

|                 BTextView                 |
|                                           |

<p>A few things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li> "View/Layout Root" is a class that combines a BView and an ArpLayoutable
      into a single object that represents the "root" of a layout hierarchy.
      You don't need to use this class, but every ArpLayoutable hierarchy
      <em>must</em> have some ArpLayoutable with an associated BView at its
      top level.
<li>  "Wrap" indicates a place where we "wrap" a raw BView-based object into
      an ArpLayoutable object, so that it can be included in the layout
      hierarchy.  While ArpLayoutable objects without BViews are allowed,
      BViews without ArpLayoutables are not -- they implicitly end the
      layout hierarchy.  (Note that this does -not- say you can not attach
      raw BView objects to other BViews in the hierarchy.  Simply that
      any such objects obviously cannot directly participate in the layout
      operation.)
</ul>

<H2>Wrapping BViews</H2>

<p>Wrapping is an important operation.  It is accomplished with the
ArpViewWrapper class, which is-a ArpLayoutable that knows how to do
useful things with a raw BView.  In particular, it can massage the
BView in such a way that a number of the Be-supplied controls will
return useful information from GetPreferredSize(), and then fill this
information into the ArpLayoutable dimensions.  It also uses special
functions of ArpLayoutable to mark its object as one that owns a
BView, so that the ArpLayoutable will do the correct thing with
coordinate spaces and other details.</p>

<p>The ArpViewWrapper can be used in one of two ways.  The simplest
is to instantiate it, passing in an instance of the BView it is to
wrap in its constructor.  This will magically include the BView in
the layout hierarchy (assuming it reports a useful preferred size).
Alternatively, one can create a subclass that is a mix-in of the
ArpViewWrapper and BView-based object it is associated with.
This method is
used in places where special code must be written to report
size information about the BView or otherwise modify its default
behavior.</p>

<H2>Constraints</H2>

<p>In order to perform any kind of complicated layout operation,
a layout manager will need to associate some special information with
its children.  This is additional information attached to a specific
child, which is used to control how it is placed in the container's
area.  Examples of constraints are such things as a "weight", which
controls how much of the parent's space is given to one child in
relation to its others, or "gravity", which determines how a child
will be placed in a larger area that it does not need.</p>

<p>Constraints are a difficult issue because they have two conflicting
needs: the child must own the constraints, but only the parent knows
what they are.</p>

<p>ArpLayout solves this problem by implementing constraints as a
BMessage.  Every ArpLayoutable includes a BMessage that contains
its constraints.  The ArpLayoutable object owns this BMessage object
as part of its data, but doesn't touch it: instead, there is an
interface for its parent to retrieve it and examine or modify it
as needed.</p>

<H2>Parameters and Globals</H2>

<p>The ArpLayoutable class includes an additional capability, the
management of "parameters" associated with a single object
and "globals" associated with an entire layout hierarchy.</p>

<p>Note: this is NOT an intrinsic part of the layout architecture.
In fact, I am tempted to remove it -- it adds a lot of additional
complexity to the library that could just be dropped and, as
a first prototype of an idea, I am not sure that I am happy with
how it turned out.  (I am particularily not satisfied with how poorly
the Be-supplied controls react to the dynamic environment I was trying
to create, that is another story...)</p>

<p>On the other hand, this <em>does</em> make it quite a bit easier
to write an example program that shows off how the ArpLayout
library works.  So for now, I am leaving it in...  but I am not
going to include any more real documentation on it.  The ArpLayoutable
class header includes fairly extensive comments on how these two
things work, if you are interested.</p>

<HR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=#ff0000>Classes</FONT></H1>

<H2>
ArpLayoutable
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpLayout/ArpLayoutable.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is the base class for the layout architecture, defining
the interaction between objects in a hierarchy.  It is not intended
to be directly instantiated; instead, you will want to use one
of the pre-built subclasses, or make your own to implement either
a layout manager or, combined with a BView, a control.</p>

<p>The ArpLayoutable header file is extensively commented, so that
is currently the place to go for information on this class.</p>

<H2>
ArpLView
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpLayout/ArpLView.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>ArpLView is-a mix-in of a BView and an ArpViewWrapper.  Essentially,
it is the moral equivalent of BView, but for classes that want to implement
controls that automatically work with the ArpLayout architecture.  When
implementing a subclass, you should implement all of the normal BView
stuff (except GetPreferredSize()), as well as the ArpLayoutable
methods you need to override.  In particular, you should always override
ComputeDimens() to return the appropriate dimensions of your object.
Layout managers also must override Layout().
</p>

<H2>
ArpRootLayout
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpLayout/ArpRootLayout.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>ArpRootLayout is-a ArpLView that is specialized to be the
root of a layout hierarchy.  There are four important parts to this:</p>

<ul>
<li> The object marks itself as the root (by overriding IsLayoutRoot()),
so that the underlying ArpLayoutable knows that its own dimensions are
not to be touched -- the ArpRootLayout is under the direct control of
its parent BView.
<li> ArpRootLayout intercepts FrameResized() events so that its
underlying layout hierarchy will be forced to conform to its size.
<li> The class includes a BMessage containing the global parameter
values for its underlying layout hierarchy, and supplies functions
for retrieving and manipulating them.
<li> If the ArpRootLayout is out the top level of a BView tree (that is,
its direct parent is a window), it can help integrate that window with
the layout hierarchy by automatically setting its size limits.
</ul>

<p>An ArpRootLayout can only contain one child.  This is typically
a manager widget that knows how to place multiple children in its area.</p>

<H2>
ArpRunningBar
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpLayout/ArpRunningBar.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is the only general-purpose manager widget that is currently
included with the ArpLayout library.  It simply places all
of its children next to each other, in either a horizontal or
vertical direction.  When the running bar has extra space that
goes beyond the childrens' preferred size, it will distribute this
amongst them according to a weighting factor: each child is given
a single float weight; the amount of space it gets is directly
proportional to its weight relative to its other children.  If a
child's weight is zero, its size is never grown beyond
its preferred size.</p>

<p>For example, consider three children with weights (0, 1, and 2).
The running bar reports it preferred size to be that of the sum of
its children sizes, so that it is always given enough space to
contain them.  If it is made larger than that, it will distribute
any extra space beyond that summed preferred size based on their
weights.  Say we add 60 pixels to its size.  The additional
space assigned the children is, in order, (0, 20, 40).</p>

<H2>
ArpScrollArea
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpLayout/ArpScrollArea.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>ArpScrollArea is a specialized layout manager for a child that
will be placed within a larger scrollable area.  It is a complete
reimplementation of the BScrollArea, because BScrollArea does not
work at all well with the ArpLayout library.</p>

<p>This layout manager can only have one child, which is the view
to scroll around in.  The child ArpLayoutable <em>must</em> have
an associated BView object for it to attach to.  This class uses
normal BScrollBar objects as the controls around the scrollable
view, and these require the BView for something to hold on to.</p>

<H2>
ArpViewWrapper
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpLayout/ArpViewWrapper.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is a simple subclass of ArpLayoutable that allows you to
"wrap up" a raw BView-based object into an ArpLayoutable that the
layout library can manipulate.  The resulting combination (either
as one instance holding another, or a mix-in of the two classes)
can then be seamlessly used within a layout hierarchy.</p>

<p>This class also implements some special magic to try to get
usable preferred size dimensions from Be's supplied control
classes.  However, very few of them actually work.  The ones that
I do know work (and hence don't require subclassing) are:</p>

<ul>
<li> BButton (but not if you dynamically change its font size)
<li> BRadioBox
<li> BColorControl
</ul>

<H2>
ViewStubs
<small>
<a href="../../ArpHeader/ArpLayout/ViewStubs.h">(header file)</a>
</small>
</H2>

<p>This is actually a file that contains a collection of stub
classes to fix problems that keep some Be-supplied controls from
working with the ArpLayout library.  In other words, it does
what we'd really like to avoid: subclasses Be objects with thin
wrappers.</p>

<p>The following classes are included (their corresponding Be
class should be easy to figure out):</p>

<ul>
<li> ArpBox
<li> ArpButton
<li> ArpListView
<li> ArpOutlineListView
<li> ArpMenuBar
<li> ArpMenuField
<li> ArpTextControl
</ul>

<p>A number of others will have to be created (I know, for example,
that BStringView doesn't work by itself), but these are the only
ones I have needed so far.</p>

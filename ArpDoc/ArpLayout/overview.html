@title Overview

<p>The ArpLayout library implements a traditional "layout manager / control"
GUI architecture.  That is, there are two fairly distinct types of
classes:</p>

<dl>
<dt> Controls
<dd> <p>These are the parts of the interface that the user interacts with.
     A control always a BView, because it needs to see user events such
     as the keyboard and mouse to provide something the user can
     interact with.</p>

     <p>In addition to all of the functionality of a BView, a control must
     be able to report accurate information about its dimensions based
     on its current font and other parts of the environment.  This is
     similar to the existing BView::GetPreferredSize() method, but
     includes a bit more information and <em>must</em> return a
     useful value, whatever the object's current state.</p>

     <p>(Unfortunately, the GetPreferredSize() implemented in a lot of the
     Be-supplied
     classes is either touchy about returning correct information
     or doesn't return anything useful at all.)</p>

<dt> Layout Managers
<dd> <p>These are the objects used to construct an actual
     layout hierarchy.  A layout manager contains one or more child
     objects, and implements a specific algorithm to determine where
     the children should be placed within the manager's screen space
     (i.e. its Bounds() rectangle) and how big they should be.
     Ideally, the library architecture should allow a layout manager
     class to implement any arbitrary layout algorithm it likes.</p>

     <p>The children of a layout manager may be either basic controls
     or other layout managers.  Building a tree of layout managers
     and controls defines an explicit relationship between the various
     user interface objects, so that they will automatically be
     correctly positioned based on the font(s) being used and the
     size of the containing area.</p>

     <p>A layout manager is often not associated with an actual
     BView -- it does not need to directly interact with the user,
     so there is no need to include all of that overhead.  Two
     layout managers currently come with the ArpLayout library,
     ArpRunningBar and ArpScrollArea.</p>
</dl>

<p>The core piece of the ArpLayout library is a class called
ArpLayoutable.  This is a simple base class (derived only from
BArchivable) that defines the abstract interface between parent
and child in the layout hierarchy.  Its major pieces of
functionality are:</p>

<dl>
<dt> The ability to query an object for its desired dimensions.
<dd> A layout manager uses this capability of its children to determine
     how best to place them.
<dt> Managing the position and size of an object.
<dd> A layout manager uses this capability of its children to actually
     put them where it wants them to go.
<dt> The ability to associate "constraints" with an object.
<dd> These are used as parameters to the layout manager, which
     provides additional information about how to place
     the child that they are associated with.
<dt> The association of a BView with an ArpLayoutable.
<dd> An ArpLayoutable object may not be associated with
     a BView if it doesn't need to interact with the
     user.  There are various functions to manage this situation.
</dl>

<H2>The Layout Hierarchy</H2>

<p>At the most fundamental level, ArpLayoutable provides a set of functions for
managing a hierarchy of object.  These directly match the ones found in BView:</p>

<blockquote><table>
	<tr> <td>AddLayoutChild() <td>AddChild() </tr>
	<tr> <td>RemoveLayoutChild() <td>RemoveChild() </tr>
	<tr> <td>LayoutParent() <td>Parent() </tr>
	<tr> <td>CountLayoutChildren() <td>CountChildren() </tr>
	<tr> <td>LayoutChildAt() <td>ChildAt() </tr>
	<tr> <td>NextLayoutSibling() <td>NextSibling() </tr>
	<tr> <td>PreviousLayoutSibling() <td>PreviousSibling() </tr>
	<tr> <td>LayoutRemoveSelf() <td>LayoutRemoveSelf() </tr>
	<tr> <td>FindLayoutable() <td>FindView() </tr>
</table></blockquote>

<p>This is an important point: The ArpLayoutable class defines an
<em>additional</em> hierarchy, on top of the existing BView hierarchy.
This relationship is easy to derive -- the underlying BView hierarchy
is simply the ArpLayoutable hierarchy with all of the objects that
do not have an associated BView object removed.</p>

<p>Another way to think of this is as light-weight ArpLayoutable objects
sitting "in-between" the full BViews, guiding them in the layout.
For example, consider a simple BView hierarchy such as this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
BView Root -+- BMenuBar
            +- BTextView
            +- BBox ------+- BButton
                          +- BButton
                          +- BButton
</pre></blockquote>

<p>This may be embedded within a larger ArpLayoutable hierarchy
that runs like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
View/Layout Root - VerticalGroup -+- Wrap - BMenuBar
                                  +- Wrap - BTextView
                                  +- Wrap - BBox --- HorizontalGroup -+- Wrap - BButton
                                                                      +- Wrap - BButton
                                                                      +- Wrap - BButton
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Which would probably result in a window that looks something like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
 _____________
/Layout Window\_____________________________
|                                           |
| BMenuBar                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|
|                                           |
|                                           |
|                 BTextView                 |
|                                           |
|                                           |

<p>A few things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li> "View/Layout Root" is a class that combines a BView and an ArpLayoutable
      into a single object that represents the "root" of a layout hierarchy.
      You don't need to use this class, but every ArpLayoutable hierarchy
      <em>must</em> have some ArpLayoutable with an associated BView at its
      top level.
<li>  "Wrap" indicates a place where we "wrap" a raw BView-based object into
      an ArpLayoutable object, so that it can be included in the layout
      hierarchy.  While ArpLayoutable objects without BViews are allowed,
      BViews without ArpLayoutables are not -- they implicitly end the
      layout hierarchy.  (Note that this does -not- say you can not attach
      raw BView objects to other BViews in the hierarchy.  Simply that
      any such objects obviously cannot directly participate in the layout
      operation.)
</ul>

<H2>Wrapping BViews</H2>

<p>Wrapping is an important operation.  It is accomplished with the
ArpViewWrapper class, which is-a ArpLayoutable that knows how to do
useful things with a raw BView.  In particular, it can massage the
BView in such a way that a number of the Be-supplied controls will
return useful information from GetPreferredSize(), and then fill this
information into the ArpLayoutable dimensions.  It also uses special
functions of ArpLayoutable to mark its object as one that owns a
BView, so that the ArpLayoutable will do the correct thing with
coordinate spaces and other details.</p>

<p>The ArpViewWrapper can be used in one of two ways.  The simplest
is to instantiate it, passing in an instance of the BView it is to
wrap in its constructor.  This will magically include the BView in
the layout hierarchy (assuming it reports a useful preferred size).
Alternatively, one can create a subclass that is a mix-in of the
ArpViewWrapper and BView-based object it is associated with.
This method is
used in places where special code must be written to report
size information about the BView or otherwise modify its default
behavior.</p>

<H2>Constraints</H2>

<p>In order to perform any kind of complicated layout operation,
a layout manager will need to associate some special information with
its children.  This is additional information attached to a specific
child, which is used to control how it is placed in the container's
area.  Examples of constraints are such things as a "weight", which
controls how much of the parent's space is given to one child in
relation to its others, or "gravity", which determines how a child
will be placed in a larger area that it does not need.</p>

<p>Constraints are a difficult issue because they have two conflicting
needs: the child must own the constraints, but only the parent knows
what they are.</p>

<p>ArpLayout solves this problem by implementing constraints as a
BMessage.  Every ArpLayoutable includes a BMessage that contains
its constraints.  The ArpLayoutable object owns this BMessage object
as part of its data, but doesn't touch it: instead, there is an
interface for its parent to retrieve it and examine or modify it
as needed.</p>

<H2>Parameters and Globals</H2>

<p>The ArpLayoutable class includes an additional capability, the
management of "parameters" associated with a single object
and "globals" associated with an entire layout hierarchy.</p>

<p>Note: this is NOT an intrinsic part of the layout architecture.
In fact, I am tempted to remove it -- it adds a lot of additional
complexity to the library that could just be dropped and, as
a first prototype of an idea, I am not sure that I am happy with
how it turned out.  (I am particularily not satisfied with how poorly
the Be-supplied controls react to the dynamic environment I was trying
to create, that is another story...)</p>

<p>On the other hand, this <em>does</em> make it quite a bit easier
to write an example program that shows off how the ArpLayout
library works.  So for now, I am leaving it in...  but I am not
going to include any more real documentation on it.  The ArpLayoutable
class header includes fairly extensive comments on how these two
things work, if you are interested.</p>

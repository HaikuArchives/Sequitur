 *
 * History
 * ~~~~~~~
 * 05.10.00		hackborn
 * Changed the 'PPQN' terminology to 'Tick' which is more accurate.
 *
 * 11.01.98		hackborn
 * Changed PPQNToPixel to send floor() and the new pixel value before returning.
 * That I need to do this is a little odd, I think, I didn't have to before the
 * rewrite.  Will this affect things as the song gets longer?  It was for the
 * MeasureBackground that I did this.
 *
 * 10.27.98		hackborn
 * Added STR_AMTIMECONVERTER define.
 *
 * 10.20.98		hackborn
 * Did some minor code clean-up: Switched the old-style MIDI time datatypes
 * (uint32) to the new AmTime.  Renamed member variables to the new-style
 * m- prefix.
 *
 * 08.10.98		hackborn
 * Mutated this file from its original incarnation.

 * AM-TIME-CONVERTER
 * This is a conversion kit that can be plugged into whomever
 * needs it.  it is for converting MIDI ticks to pixels and vice
 * versa.  The beatConversion var must be set before this class
 * is useful (either via the (long) instantiation method or the
 * SetBeatLength() method).
 * NOTE:  We CAN'T have a beatConversion of 0, that must be avoided.
 * Unrealistic beatConversions tend to produce disastrous results.
 *
 * Realistically, it seems like this should be in view code.

This is the class you should derive from when implementing a
layout manager that doesn't need a full BView context.  It
is a mix-in of ArpBaseLayout and BHandler, creating a full class
that can be used in the layout hierarchy.  You can also instantiate
this raw class if you just want to place spacers in a layout.

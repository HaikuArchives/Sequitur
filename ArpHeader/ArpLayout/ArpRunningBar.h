 * high-level relationships between the different user interface
 * object through formal container classes, which then take care

 * ArpRunningBar.h
 *
 * A layout class that organizes its children as a horizontal
 * or vertical row.  Each child object can be assigned a weight,
 * which is used to determine how to space the objects along
 * the horizontal or vertical axis.

 * To Do
 * ~~~~~
 *
 * â€¢ Add "make equal size" option.

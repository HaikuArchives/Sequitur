 * A class that encapsulates all of the garbage needed to
 * track the mouse pointer when doing drag operations.  This
 * means creating a thread, watching for changes in mouse
 * position, and sleeping so we don't chew many cycles.
 * It is intended to be used as a mix-in class: you combine
 * it with the class that is derived from BView, and override
 * the TrackMouse*() functions as you would BView's Mouse*()
 * functions.

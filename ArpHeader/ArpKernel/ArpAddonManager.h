 * ArpAddonManager.h
 *
 * This class keeps track of a set of add-ons in which a program
 * is interested.  It is derived from ArpMultiDir, providing
 * all of that class's functionality of searching through
 * multiple directories for files.  On top of that, the
 * ArpAddonManager keeps track of the add-ons it finds and
 * provides an interface for accessing them.
 *
 * The interface here is presented as something upon which more
 * specific add-on interfaces may be built; it defines nothing
 * about the internal structure of the add-ons it manipulates.
 *
 * Note on locking:
 * The ArpAddonManager is also a subclass of BLocker. All of
 * its functions make sure the object is locked before they do
 * anything, so you may not have to worry about locking it
 * yourself.  However, note that if you are doing anything
 * with a BasicAddon object in the manager, you must be sure
 * to lock the manager before you retrieve the addon object,
 * and keep it locked until you are done with it.  Otherwise,
 * you may let other threads trample over the addon object you
 * are using -- or even deallocate it from under you!
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Known Bugs
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *	â€¢ Should check attributes on each file it finds, to make
 *	  sure they are actually add-ons.  Currently, we don't
 *	  find out about this <ahem> slight problem until actually
 *	  calling Open() on a BasicAddon object.

 * ArpNotificationRegistry.h
 *
 * This file contains a class that is responsible for storing a list of
 * BHandlers with an interest in some piece of data, and sending notices
 * to them.  In many cases, the class which BHandlers will be requesting
 * notification from will subclass this registry.
 * 
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Known Bugs
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *	â€¢ In both NotifyDependents() functions, there is now a flag to tell
 * the notify method to deliver asynchronously -- return immediately --
 * or not.  This flag is a PLACE HOLDER.  There is no current capability
 * to actually deliver the messages asynchronously, but it's there for
 * clients who depend upon this behaviour being one way or the other.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * History
 * ~~~~~~~
 * 12.14.1998		dianne
 * Now uses BMessengers as notification destination, rather than
 * raw BHandlers.
 * 11.23.1998		hackborn
 * Added fake ability to notify dependents asynchronously.  See known bugs.

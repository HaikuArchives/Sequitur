 * ArpTerminalInterface.h
 *
 * The ArpTerminalInterface class describes an abstract interface
 * to some terminal-like device.  It is the interface through
 * which particular emulator implementations may manipulate
 * the terminal they are connected to: it defines various
 * functions for manipulating the terminal screen and
 * getting/setting general state information.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Known Bugs
 * ~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 *	• I am not currently trying to maintain binary compatibility with
 *	  new versions of this interface.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * History
 * ~~~~~~~
 *
 * 2/1/1998:
 *	• Major release, corresponding to ArpTelnet v2.0.
 *
 * 8/18/1997:   *** THIS BREAKS BINARY COMPATIBILITY ***
 *	• Added version identification to interface.
 *	• Much clean-up and commentization.
 *
 * 0.1: Created this file from the WebTerm source.
